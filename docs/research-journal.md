1. Apply for RSICC SCALE / SERPENT license / software
    * RECEIVED.
2. Literature review on desalination [khan_development_2016] [khalid_comparative_2015]
    * technologies: economics:[nisan_status_2007] // explanation:[dincer_chapter_2018] 
        1. MED (Multi-effect distillation): thermal E for the aux water system
            * multistage boil and condense using different temperatures
            * 0.7 ~ 0.96 $ per cubic meter
        2. RO (Reverse osmosis): mixed E (elect + mechanical)
            * use pumps to pressurize seawater through semipermeable membrane to cause reverse osmosis.
            * 0.6 ~ 0.94 $ per cubic meter
        3. Nuclear technologies were much lower
            * MED coupled to PWR = 0.5 $ per cubic meter
        4. Nuclear reactors coupled to:
            * RO: 0.6 - 0.74 $ per cubic meter
            * MED: 0.89 $ per cubic meter
    * High-temperature gas cooled reactors is best
        1. `inherently safe`
        2. coolant is gas. Good for places with scarce water.
        3. 50 % eff.
    *
3. Benchmark paper edit.
4. Transmutation database conversion and mysql configuration
5. Install SCALE
